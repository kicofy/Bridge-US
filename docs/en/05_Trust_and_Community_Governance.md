# Trust & Community Governance

## Goal

Without sacrificing UX, make the platform:

- **less ad-polluted** (reduce marketing incentives)
- **verifiable** (traceable sources/evidence for key claims)
- **updatable** (content expires; updates and corrections are encouraged)
- **safer** (reduce scams, harassment, and privacy leaks)

## No disguised ads (core differentiation)

- **No sponsored content disguised as “experience” or “advice.”**
- Any commercial relationship must be **clearly disclosed** (prominent label + disclosure statement).
- Apply strict controls on **external links / contact sharing / lead-gen** (hidden by default or require review).

## Trust labels (explainable and enforceable)

Display:

- **verification status**: `verified` / `partially verified` / `unverified`
- **last updated**: date of last update
- **scope**: city/campus/time window (e.g., Fall 2025)
- **sources/evidence**: official links, screenshots (with redaction), optional receipts

> “Verified” doesn’t mean “perfectly correct”—it describes traceability and review completion.

## Moderation flow (recommended)

### High-level flow

1. user submits content (structured fields + optional evidence)
2. machine pre-screen (ads/sensitive/scam keywords, link policy, duplicate detection)
3. human review (volunteers/moderators)
4. publish with verification label
5. community correction & updates (supplement → re-review → update record)

### Queue strategy

- prioritize **housing/scams** highest
- sort by **risk score**: links, transfer keywords, contact info, extreme claims, etc.
- allow “needs info” to request missing: location/time/evidence/scope

## Anti-spam & anti-scam

- **rate limits**: new users limited; suspicious behavior triggers cooldown
- **near-duplicate detection**: reduce bulk spam and rewritten ads
- **link policy**: whitelist official domains; otherwise require review
- **pattern library**: scam scripts, transfer prompts, fake discounts
- **report loop**: report → categorize (spam/scam/harassment/privacy) → trackable resolution

## Safety & privacy defaults

- default anonymity (nickname), forbid publishing sensitive info (phone, unit number, IDs, etc.)
- media handling: EXIF stripping; optional auto-redaction (phone/face/address)
- volunteer support uses **ticket workflows** (no direct contact exposure) + safety/boundary guidance

## Incentives (optimize for helpfulness, not hype)

- “**Helpful**” instead of “Likes”
- contribution credit:
  - structured, reusable submissions
  - content that passes review and earns verified/partially verified
  - updating expired content
  - participating in verification/translation
- guardrails: prevent “points → exposure privilege” abuse; require anti-gaming controls
