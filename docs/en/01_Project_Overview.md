# Project Overview (Bridge US)

## One-line positioning

An **ad-free (no disguised promotions)** information + mutual-help platform for international students new to the US—powered by **real experiences, traceable sources, and human verification** to reduce confusion, stress, and isolation.

## Vision

Every newly arrived international student can make key decisions (housing, transportation, healthcare, safety) with **trustworthy, verifiable, reusable** guidance—and can reach **safe, real human support** when needed.

## Core principles

- **Real experiences first**: insights come from students and volunteers—not marketing.
- **Trust through traceability**: critical information shows sources, update time, and verification status.
- **Community-first**: prioritize student wellbeing over ad-driven ranking.
- **AI assists, humans own responsibility**: AI for speed/coverage; humans for review/endorsement.
- **Privacy & safety by default**: minimize data collection and exposure to reduce harassment/scam risk.

## Differentiation

- **No sponsored posts disguised as advice**: any commercial interest must be clearly labeled.
- **Helpfulness over likes**: reward content that solves problems, not content that farms attention.
- **Content lifecycle management**: expiration warnings, update incentives, and change history to avoid outdated misinformation.
- **Safety-oriented support system**: volunteer connections via controlled workflows and safety guidance.

## Product boundaries (explicitly not doing / cautious)

- No “anything-goes” housing marketplace (high fraud risk requires strict controls).
- Not an “ad feed” business model (avoids incentives that distort trust).
- No definitive legal/medical conclusions; provide general guidance + official links, with clear disclaimers.
