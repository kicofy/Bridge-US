# Objectives & Problem Definition

## Objectives

- **Provide trustworthy information**: accurate, traceable, and updatable guidance for daily life in the US.
- **Reduce adaptation costs**: lower confusion, stress, trial-and-error, and isolation for newcomers.
- **Build a mutual-help community**: real experiences (housing, transportation, shopping, “what I wish I knew”) become a reusable knowledge base.
- **AI + human collaboration**: AI for instant Q&A and retrieval; humans for verification, context, and responsibility.

## The problem

Many platforms mix signals:

- **Helpful content mixed with ads**: users must filter promotional posts and paid recommendations.
- **Marketing incentives distort advice**: “recommendations” can be biased or commercially motivated.
- **Newcomers face severe information asymmetry**: housing, contracts, commuting, scam detection—easy to get wrong.

For newly arrived international students, this leads to:

- **Misleading housing information**: fake listings, deposit/transfer traps, contract pitfalls, safety risks.
- **Unreliable guides**: outdated processes, misunderstood policies, advice that doesn’t match a city/campus.
- **Mental and social stress**: no trusted person to ask; anxiety and isolation increase.

## Solution overview

Build a website specifically for international students, including:

- transportation guides, city living checklists, and groceries/traditional food resources
- student-shared housing experiences and “avoid-the-pitfall” stories
- scam awareness (case library + verification checklists)
- a safe volunteer connection system (controlled flow + privacy protection)
- AI quick Q&A grounded in **reviewed content**, with sources and trust labels

## What success looks like

- **Trustworthiness**: key content is source-traceable with clear verification status and update time.
- **Time saved**: students make core decisions faster (housing, commuting, shopping, life admin).
- **Sustainable community**: contributors and volunteers keep participating; content updates and corrections continue.
- **Safety control**: scams/harassment/spam are contained; user privacy is protected by default.
