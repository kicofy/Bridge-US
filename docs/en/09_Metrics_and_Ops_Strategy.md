# Metrics & Operations Strategy

## North Star Metric

**The number of times an international student’s “critical question” is reliably resolved.**  
Track via a combination of:

- AI answers that are accepted and lead to source clicks (useful + traceable)
- Guides/experience posts marked “Helpful” and saved/shared
- High-risk scenarios (housing/scams) where users complete a verification checklist and report “avoided a pitfall”

## Key metrics (by module)

### Content quality

- reviewed content coverage (especially housing/scams)
- update rate for content older than 6 months
- correction loop speed (report → re-review → update)
- report handling SLA (e.g., within 24–48 hours)

### AI Q&A

- first-answer success rate (no follow-up needed / “resolved” selected)
- source click-through rate (traceability)
- high-risk warning trigger rate and downstream behavior (checklist opens)
- hallucination/error rate (sampling + user feedback)

### Governance & safety

- scam/ad block rate (AI pre-screen + human review)
- false positive rate (legit content blocked)
- spam/point-gaming detection hit rate
- privacy incidents (target: ~0)

### Community & growth

- 7-day and 30-day retention
- contributor participation rate and cadence
- city/campus coverage growth
- volunteer ticket completion rate and satisfaction

## Operations (0 → 1)

### Seed content strategy (solve the first cohort’s problems)

- start with 1–2 pilot cities/campuses
- launch 4 “high leverage” topics first:
  - First 7 days checklist
  - Housing 30 days checklist (with verification checklist)
  - Safety & scams hub (weekly updates)
  - Transportation + groceries map (expand over time)

### Contributor & volunteer recruitment

- recruit via campus communities / student orgs / mentors
- contribution templates to reduce writing cost
- transparent moderation standards & boundaries to reduce disputes

### Cadence

- weekly “update day” (refresh stale items, summarize new scam patterns)
- monthly “coverage milestones” (add 1–2 new cities/campuses)
- always keep high-risk content under strict review (transfers, services, contact sharing)

## Pilot SOP (suggested)

- Week 1: collect 50 real questions → publish 20 guides + 20 experiences + 10 scam cases
- Week 2: launch AI Q&A (reviewed-only), enable corrections
- Weeks 3–4: volunteer ticket pilot (fixed daily time windows)
- Weekly retro: errors, false positives, user feedback, missing content backlog
