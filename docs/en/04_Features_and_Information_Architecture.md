# Features & Information Architecture

## Information architecture (IA)

Organize content across three dimensions:

- **Location** (city/campus)
- **Section** (user stage / job-to-be-done)
- **Topics** (fine-grained tags)

## Sections (top-level entry points)

Sections answer “What stage am I in / what am I trying to do?”

- **First week**: phone/bank/transport card, temporary stay, basic shopping, campus check-in, emergency contacts
- **Housing & move-in**: viewing checklist, lease/deposit, roommates, safety/commute, scam patterns & verification steps
- **Food & groceries**: traditional ingredients, grocery maps, substitutes, price ranges, saving tips
- **Transportation**: transit/campus shuttle, night safety, common apps, student discounts
- **Life admin**: healthcare/insurance, paperwork, taxes, driver’s license, carrier/bank FAQs
- **Safety & scams**: high-risk patterns, alerts, rules, reporting/help paths (strict moderation)

(Optional later: saving & second-hand, campus resources & social, wellbeing & adjustment)

## Core modules

### Content (Guides + Experiences)

- **Guides / checklists**: structured content (steps, links, notes, update date)
- **Experience posts**: real stories (optionally anonymous), template fields for comparability
- **Tags & filters**: city/campus/section/topics/budget/commute/safety/language

### Housing (highest priority)

- **Real housing experiences**: rent range, area (can be coarse), commute, safety score, contract notes
- **Pitfalls & scams**: common tricks, verification checklist, transfer risks
- **Safety controls**: hide sensitive info by default; control links/contact exposure

### Transportation & daily life

- transit/shuttle, key apps, tickets/discounts, night commuting safety
- traditional food & groceries by area, price range, and substitutes

### Volunteer connection (controlled)

- ticket-style requests: category, time window, language, anonymity needs
- volunteer review & matching, boundaries, and enforcement

### Quality & governance (platform foundation)

- report/appeal
- moderation queue + evidence management
- anti-spam / anti-ad / anti-scam
- expiration reminders and update incentives

## MVP priorities

### MVP (build what truly solves problems first)

- browse by city/campus + section (more intuitive than topics alone)
- submit guides/experience posts with template fields
- basic moderation flow (pending/approved/rejected/needs info)
- safety & scams pages
- AI Q&A MVP: retrieve only from reviewed content; show sources and trust markers

### Phase 2 enhancements

- volunteer ticket system (matching, SLA, feedback)
- versioning + update reminders
- stronger spam detection + near-duplicate detection
- multilingual collaboration and review

### High-risk features (later or tightly controlled)

- housing marketplace / sublease matchmaking (requires strong KYC/escrow/risk controls)
- direct messaging (requires moderation/audit/anti-harassment controls)
