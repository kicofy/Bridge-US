# Target Users & Key Scenarios

## Primary users

- **International students new to the US (0–6 months)**
  - Goal: quickly build “survival capability” (housing, transportation, shopping, healthcare, safety)
  - Traits: high information asymmetry, time pressure, higher anxiety, lower scam awareness

## Secondary users

- **Current international students / alumni (contributors)**
  - Goal: share experiences and help newcomers avoid pitfalls
  - Traits: strong local context; limited time; need low-friction contribution templates
- **Volunteers (online support)**
  - Goal: provide Q&A support and help with verification/translation
  - Traits: need clear boundaries, workflows, and safety protections
- **Moderators / reviewers (governance)**
  - Goal: ensure quality, reduce scams, maintain community culture
  - Traits: need tooling for queues, evidence management, and appeals

## Typical user journeys

### Journey A: First week after arrival (high frequency)

- Needs: phone plan/bank/transport card, groceries, neighborhood safety, how to commute
- Actions:
  - choose city/campus → open “First 7 days checklist”
  - ask AI quick Q&A → see sources + update date → save/share
  - spot outdated content → submit an “update suggestion”

### Journey B: Housing & move-in (high risk)

- Needs: listing authenticity, neighborhood safety, contract notes, deposit/sublease risk, scam detection
- Actions:
  - enter housing section → filter by budget/commute/safety → read real experiences
  - see “verified/partially verified” labels and evidence
  - request human help → open a “safe volunteer support” ticket

### Journey C: Longer-term life (ongoing value)

- Needs: saving money, healthcare/insurance, taxes, driver’s license, campus resources, work rules
- Actions:
  - subscribe to city/campus tags → receive “important updates”
  - contribute experiences → earn helpfulness-based recognition

## Key pain points → design responses

- **Hard to judge truth** → source links + verification status + update date
- **Ad / marketing noise** → ban disguised sponsorship; mandatory promotion labels
- **Afraid to ask / privacy risk** → default anonymity + safety tips + controlled communication
- **Content becomes outdated** → lifecycle management (expiration prompts, update incentives, version history)
